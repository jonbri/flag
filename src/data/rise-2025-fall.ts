    "At the first practice, the league commissioner informed us that there was no head coach, but called out my name because I had checked the 'asst. coach' box during signup. So, I became the head coach. Two other fathers, Joe and Richard joined as assistant coaches and helped out a lot. Coach Joe is Grayson's father.",
